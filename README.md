# Implementation and Comparison of sorting algorithms
Javascript Version : ES-2015
HTML : HTML5 

Random Arrays can be geerated using the generate random 10,000 or the range random generator.

To run the code just let all the files be in one folder and run the html file on the browser. HTML file has reference to the css and the js files used so it should be in the same folder.

Files:-
1)index.html :-
The index.html file contains the html code for the graph and various buttons and random generators for the input and the referenced to the functions they call in order for the sorting methods to work.

2) index.css
It is used to enhance the physical appearance of the html like aligning elements and for the graphical representation of the output and hence make the web page more presentable.

3)Functions.js
It contains the basic functions that control the functionality of the User Interface and hence binds it to the html features like various buttons like random number generator(generateRandom), range generator(setRange), sorting algorithm comparison function(sort and compareAll) which runs all the sorting algos at once and hence compares them and graphically represents them. 

4) sortMethods.js 
It contains all the sorting methods used to sort the input arrays like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort and 3 median quick sort.

5) DAA Project Report.docx
Contains the documentation of the code.
